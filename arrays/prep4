OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which bundle data (attributes) and behavior (methods/functions) together.

Instead of focusing only on functions and logic (like in procedural programming), OOP focuses on real-world entities such as a Car, Student, Employee, Book, etc.
