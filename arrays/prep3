optimistic concurrency control, which ensured data integrity without locking the entire system. This experience taught me a lot about building resilient systems."

Conflict Resolution Example üí¨
"During a project, my team had a disagreement on the best architecture for our notifications system. I resolved the conflict by suggesting a phased approach. We implemented a simpler version first to meet the deadline and then planned to build a more complex, scalable solution in a later phase. This satisfied both parties and allowed us to move forward efficiently."

Failure Example üòî
"In the early stages of Crop ERA, I made a mistake with a humidity unit mismatch, which caused incorrect recommendations. It was a failure in my initial data handling. To fix it, I implemented data normalization and added contract tests to prevent similar unit mismatches from happening again. I learned the importance of meticulous data validation and testing from this experience."

Where Do You See Yourself in 5 Years? üöÄ
"In five years, I see myself as a senior backend or full-stack engineer. I aim to not only contribute to the technical architecture but also to mentor junior developers and help them grow, as I believe in a culture of continuous learning and knowledge sharing."
